============================

Repository for the code, and all documentation for the TFYA50 CDIO-Project

## Git Basics
'git status' gives you information on what will be commited (se below) to your version of the repo.
'git add <file>' tells git to add <file> to your commit.
'git commit' this tells git to update your local version of the repo.
'git push origin <branch>' this tells git to update the <branch>-branch of the global repo. origin is the remote repo at github, do not change this, it is NOT a variable!
	- <branch> will usually be master, but it might be some other thing. I might explain branches, if the need arises.
'git pull origin ?<branch>?' update your local version of <branch> to the version stored at origin, again, origin is NOT a variable, do not change. <branch> is not necessary, if omitted the whole repo will be updated.

Hope that helps!

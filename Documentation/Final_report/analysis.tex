\section{Analysis}

\subsection{Reaching equilibrium}
The system was considered to be in equilibrium

\subsection{Total and cohesive energy}
Theoretically, the total energy should be constant during the whole simulation (energy conservation). However, we can se som minor fluctruations of the value, at most 0.01 \% of the average value (See fig. \ref{totale} (it behaves the same in both bulk and surface simulations). This is most probably depending on that rounded values have to be used in the calculations. Since the fluctruations are so small after reaching equilibrium, we consider it being constant enough to run a descent simulation. 
The value of the total energy equals to the sum of the potantial and the kinetic energy, just like it should theoretically.
\subsubsection{Cohesive energy}
The cohesive energy has an average value of 1.93 eV in the main test simulation. It is hard to find any tabulated values to compare with for that temperature, so we made a test run at T=0K also. Here, the average cohesive energy was 2.34 eV, which is not the same but within a reasonable range from the tabulated value wich was found to be 2.95 eV \cite{kittel}.

\subsection{Kinetic energy and temperature}
The kinetic energy and temperature are strictly connected to eachother, which is also showed when comparing 

\subsection{Potential energy}
After reaching equilibrium, the potential energy fluctruates with less than 0.1\%. The 

\subsection{MSD and diffusion coefficient}
The mean square displacement (MSD) shows how much the atoms have moved in average from their original position. This divided by 6*the-total-time Results in the diffusion coefficient which can be used to see that equilibrium is reached. The graph in figure \ref{fig:Diffusion_coeff} shows how the diffusion coefficient drops over time. The run is made from start ant for 50,000 timesteps and shows that the bulk reaches equilibrium.

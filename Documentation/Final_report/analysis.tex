\section{Analysis}

\subsection{Reaching equilibrium}

\subsection{Total energy}
Theoretically, the total energy should be constant during the whole simulation. However, we can se som minor fluctruations of the value, at most 0.01 \% of the average value (See fig. \ref{totale} (it behaves the same in both bulk and surface simulations). This is most probably depending on that rounded values have to be used in the calculations. Since the fluctruations are so small after reaching equilibrium, we consider it being constant enough to run a descent simulation. 
The value of the total energy equals to the sum of the potantial and the kinetic energy, just like it should theoretically.

\section{Simulations} 
In order to check the functionality of the program, a large number of simulations were done. The final test simulations were made with silver atoms placed in a fcc crystal structure and were divided into two main categories, bulk simulations and surface simulations.

\subsection{Bulk simulations}
The bulk simulations were made on a bulk of 10x10x10 unit cells, which gives a total number of 4000 atoms with fcc structure. Periodic boundary contitions were used in all three spatial directions. 

\subsection{Surface simulations}
The surface simulations were made on a surface of 10x10x2 unit sells, which gives a total number of 800 atoms. To obtain surface properties, periodic boundary conditions were only used in the x- and y-directions, but not in the z-direction.

\subsection{Simulation setup}
For all the final test simulations, both bulk and surface, on which the results presented in the next section are base on, the following settings were used:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Silver atoms
	\item FCC crystal structure
	\item Simulation starts at equilibrium (pre-simulations of 50.000 timesteps were run first to make sure that equilibrium was reached)
	\item Temperature at 500K
	\item Time step size set to 1fs
	\item Andersen thermostat with collision rate of 1%
	\item Each simulation ran for 50.000 time steps.
\end{itemize}

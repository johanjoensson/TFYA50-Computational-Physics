\section{Results}
In this section, results from silulations made with the final version of the software are presented. Plots are included when it has been considered as important to show how a property has developed during the simulations. The simulation setups are explained in the Simulations section of this report. For an analys and discussion of the result, se Analysis section.
\subsection{Energies}
Plots of the potential, kinetic and total energy are displayed to show that equilibrium is reached. 
\subsubsection{Total energy}
The total energy had an average value of -9886.78 eV for this setup and showed a fluctruation of at most 0.1\% of the average value (see plot in \ref{totale}).

\subsubsection{Kinetic energy}
The kinetic energy reached an average value of 258.73 eV and had a maximum fluctruation of 5\% from the average value (see plot in \ref{kinetic}).

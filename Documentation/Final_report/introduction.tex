\section{Introduction}
A computer program for simulating the ineractions between atoms using Molecular Dynamics (MD) has been created. The program fulfills the requirements prescribed in the Project Plan and can with some limitations reproduce the real laws of physics at the microscopic level, as further specified in 2.1 General Overview.
\subsectio{Limitations}
The program has been designed for particles for which the Lennard-Jones potential is sufficient to describe the behavior.

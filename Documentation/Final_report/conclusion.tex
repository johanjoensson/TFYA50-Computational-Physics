\section{conclusion}
The goal with this project, if summarized, was to produce a program that could do simulations on atoms in bulk or surface mode, which would result in a set of properties specified by the project directives. As provided in this document these requirements were met with an overall good accuracy. Furthermore was one of the higher level of requirements met since the program, with help from Matlab, actually can simulate how the atoms are moving to give an understanding on what that might have gone wrong if the values of the simulation is ''unreasonable''. So with that said the project group pleased with the program delivered and stars behind it.

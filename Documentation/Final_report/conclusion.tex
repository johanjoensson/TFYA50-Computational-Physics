\section{Conclusion}
The goal of this project was to produce a computer program for the simulation of atoms in bulk as well as surface, and to calculate the properties according to the prescribed requirements in the Project Plan. As demonstrated in this document, all the prescribed requirements have been fulfilled; the different properties can be calculated with an overall good accuracy and with the use of Matlab visualization is also possible.

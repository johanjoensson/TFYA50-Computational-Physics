\section{Training plan}

\subsection{Group training}
For all members of the project group to be able to contribute equally to the project, there might be some small lessons or training in the different tools that will be used, such as C/C++, git, the graphics library OpenGL etc. The group will also be given lectures and some training in MD simulations.

In the course, TFYA50, that the project is a part of there will also be lectures in entrepeneurship, some case studies and an exam. All given by Magnus Klofsten from IEI.

The MD laborations are compulsory for all group members and are given to prepare the group for the project.

\subsection{Client training}
All information necessary for the client to use the finished product will be given in the technical documentation written during the project. No other training for the client is necessary.

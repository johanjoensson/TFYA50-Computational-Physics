\section{Plan for the project phases}

\subsection{Before}
In the ''before'' phase focus will be on planning the work to be done during
the two remaining phases. In addition to planning the project there will also
be some education to prepare the group members for the project, ie.
laborations, lectures and information regarding what tools will be used during
the project.

\subsection{During}
During the ''during'' phase, focus will be on writing the code for the
MD-simulation and writing the documentation to be handed in with the finished
program.

\subsection{After}
After the delivery of the finished MD-simulation software, at this point the
client will determine whether or not the finished product satisfies the
requirements specified inte the project requirements document. Afterwards
every group member will have to fill out an evaluation and a summary of these
evaluations will be handed in to the client.

\section{An overview of the system}
\subsection{Purpose and goal}
The goal is to design, implement and operate a Molecular Dynamics (MD) program in order to reproduce the microscopic processes upon which important properties can be calculated.
If this is correctly done, it is possible to use the program to make accurate predictions for that class of materials.

\subsection{Deliverables}
The project group have to deliver a  MD computer program that should reliably simulate and calculate materials behavior and properties.
A description of the program, together with the results of simulations, will be included in a final report, to be presented to the supervisor.

\subsection{What is not included}
Everything that is not included in the requirements will not be included further more will only the requirements with low/optional status be met if time is still given towards he end of the project.

\section{An overview of the system}
\subsection{Purpose and goal}
The goal is to design, implement and operate a Molecular Dynamics (MD) program in order to reproduce the microscopic processes upon which important properties can be calculated.
It will then be possible to use the program to make accurate predictions for the properties of supported materials.

\subsection{Deliverables}
The project group will deliver an MD computer program that reliably can simulate and calculate behavior and properties of certain materials.
A description of the program, together with results of simulations, will be included in a final report, to be presented to the sponsor.

\subsection{What is not included}
Anything that is not included in the requirements will not be included in the project. Requirements with low/optional status will be met only if time is still available towards the end of the project.

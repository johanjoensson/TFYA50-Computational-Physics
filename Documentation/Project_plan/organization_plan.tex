\section{Organization plan} %%SW
This part aims to give an overview of the organizational parts of the project, first for the whole project and then for the customer, group and last responsibilities.
\subsection{Organization plan for the whole project}
The distribution of responsibility and an overview of the communication are given in figure\ref{FlowOrg}.

The contact between the customer and the group goes mainly through the project leader. Every group member has his own area of responsibility and it is the PM:s responsibility to make sure that all the group members work toward the same goal, that no tollgates/milestones are missed, and that there is at least one group member responsible for every task. The PM also divides the project group into smaller groups throughout the project so that the workload is evenly distributed over all the members. The experts may be consulted when required, to solve parts of the project or when problems occur.
\subsection{The customer organization}
The customer is responsible for approving the tollgates and should be informed/consulted when the milestones are reached.
\subsection{Conditions for the cooperation in the project group}
There is a letter of agreement that will be discussed and developed from the template in Appendix \ref{LetterOA}. The finished group contract will then be signed by all members.

\section{Milestones and tollgates} %%SW
The milestones are aimed mainly to help the group to keep track of its process so that the time table and activities gets done accordingly. Every milestone is a set of one or more requirements and/or tasks that should be met at the due date. The milestones are all listed below with description and due date. The tollgates are set by the customer. At every tollgate the customer has the right to shut down the project if it's not fulfill the requirements at that tollgate.

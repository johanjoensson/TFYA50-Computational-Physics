\section{Meeting plan}
All meetings shall be advertised at least 48 hours before the start of the meeting. Meetings may occur over lunch or when best fitted for the group. A weekly time slot for meetings will be decided by the group and all members shall keep this time slot free every week. However if there is nothing of importance to discuss reported 48 hours prior to the meeting start, it may be canceled. When a meeting is needed and it is not possible to advertise this 48 hours in advance the rules of attendance might be relaxed.
\subsection{Group meetings}
For every group meeting an agenda will be sent out prior to the start of the meeting. If the meeting is not at the weekly meeting time it needs to be addressed 48 hours prior to the meeting start via either email or SMS. The attendance is compulsory, with the exception of reasonable excuses such as sickness.
\subsection{Customer meetings}
For the customer meetings where the whole group is supposed to be present attendance is compulsory. If a group member cannot attend the meeting it should be postponed until the whole group can attend.

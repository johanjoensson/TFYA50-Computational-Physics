\section{Priorities}
The group shall first of all aim to make sure that all requirements with high/mandatory priority in the requirement specification are working sufficiently. In case of time shortage or other unexpected obstacles, the customer shall be contacted for a discussion about the requirementâ€™s necessity and potential changes in the requirement specification. Another possible reason for discussing a requirement with the customer could be that the group considers that a disproportionate amount of time is needed to fulfil a relatively unimportant requirement, such that it affects other activities and project goals negatively.

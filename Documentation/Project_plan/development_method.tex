In the Waterfall model, the following phases are followed in order:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Requirements specification (Requirements analysis)
\item Software design
\item Implementation and Integration
\item Testing (or Validation)
\item Deployment (or Installation)
\item Maintenance
\end{enumerate}

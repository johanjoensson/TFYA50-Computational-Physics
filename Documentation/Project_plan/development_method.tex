Development Method
There are many development methods, and we prefer the conventional method it is Waterfall. The waterfall model can work if everything goes to plan, but in a complex project things rarely do. The core of the problem is the reliance on getting the specification perfect before attempting to it.

The waterfall model shows a process, where developers are to follow these phases in order:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Requirements specification (Requirements analysis)
\item Software design
\item Implementation and Integration
\item Testing (or Validation)
\item Deployment (or Installation)
\item Maintenance
\end{enumerate}

\section{Quality plan}
Two different methods will be used to guarantee the quality of the product and the documentation: tests and reviews. Testing of the code will be made continuously during the project to make sure that every part of the MD program works as it should.

\subsection{Reviews}

Each new version of the documentation shall be reviewed by at least one group member before it can be regarded as ready to hand in. If nothing else is specified, DOC will do the review. The purpose of the review is to make sure that the document contains all necessary parts and that no major language or layout errors have been made.

\subsection{Test plan}

Several tests will be made continuously during the project to make sure that the requirements are fulfilled. CT is responsible for the code testing and will thus create a test plan describing how the tests shall be performed including what requirements that has to be fulfilled, as well making sure that the tests are performed.
